# Current Benchmark Analysis

Analysis of existing benchmarks in the codebase to inform a comprehensive benchmarking strategy.

## Benchmark Files

### performance_bench_test.go

**TestPerformance46M**
- What: Large-scale performance test validating SELECT protocol with 1M, 10M, and 46M rows
- Value: Essential for validating core performance claims (2.44M rows/sec) - directly supports business case
- Keep: **YES** - This is our primary performance validation test

**BenchmarkSelectProtocol**
- What: Formal benchmark version of the performance test with different row counts (100K, 1M, 10M)
- Value: Provides repeatable performance metrics and regression detection
- Keep: **YES** - Critical for performance monitoring

**BenchmarkSelectVsDirectPgx**
- What: Compares PGArrow SELECT vs pgx with CacheDescribe and SimpleProtocol modes
- Value: Demonstrates competitive advantage against standard PostgreSQL drivers
- Keep: **YES** - Key differentiation benchmark

**BenchmarkBatchSizes**
- What: Tests different batch sizes (50K, 100K, 200K, 500K) to validate optimal configuration
- Value: Limited - tests the same query with fixed batch size, not actually varying batch size
- Keep: **NO** - Misleading name, doesn't test what it claims to

### pgarrow_bench_test.go

**BenchmarkQueryArrowVsPgxText**
- What: Comprehensive comparison of PGArrow vs pgx across query types (SimpleTypes, AllSupportedTypes, various result set sizes, MixedTypesWithNulls)
- Value: High - validates core value proposition across different scenarios
- Keep: **YES** - Comprehensive validation of binary vs text format performance

**BenchmarkMemoryUsage**
- What: Compares memory allocation patterns between PGArrow and pgx for 100-row result set
- Value: Medium - useful for understanding allocation overhead but limited scope
- Keep: **YES** - Memory efficiency is important for the use case

**BenchmarkConnectionInitialization**
- What: Tests instant connection capability vs standard pgx connection setup
- Value: High - validates key architectural benefit (no metadata preloading)
- Keep: **YES** - Core architectural advantage

**BenchmarkDataTypeConversion**
- What: Fine-grained performance analysis of each data type conversion (Bool, Int2, Int4, Int8, Float4, Float8, Text)
- Value: Medium - useful for identifying type-specific performance bottlenecks
- Keep: **YES** - Important for optimization guidance

## Summary

**Files to Keep**: 2 files with strategic consolidation needed
**Benchmarks to Keep**: 7 out of 8 benchmarks
**Benchmarks to Remove**: 1 (BenchmarkBatchSizes - misleading/non-functional)

**Key Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage of core value propositions
- Good mix of integration and micro-benchmarks
- Proper comparison with standard PostgreSQL drivers

**Gaps Identified**:
- No actual batch size variation testing
- Limited coverage of connection pooling scenarios
- No benchmarks for error conditions or edge cases
- Missing large dataset streaming scenarios beyond 46M rows
